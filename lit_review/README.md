## Legend for info in table
‚≠êÔ∏è - very relevant, others should check this out

üôà - i wish i didn‚Äôt read, if two people put this then ~~strike through the title~~

‚öôÔ∏è - good info for model building (math equs or qualitative info that can easily be turned into math equations)

üìï - good qualitative info to keep in mind or reference in future

üìä - good data source
