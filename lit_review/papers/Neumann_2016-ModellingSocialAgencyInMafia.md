# Modelling social agency using diachronic cognition: learning from the Mafia

Human cognition is diachronic in that concerted bodily activity links behavior to values that co-evolve with socio-culture: slow historical processes become interlaced with interaction. ... In showing how this can be done, we use evidence regarding the historical persistence of Cosa Nostra. In Sicily, the slow processes of a cultural ecosystem, self-maintaining practices, prompt agents to self-configure and make decisions that sustain the mafia. ... Agent-based simulation serves to pursue how time-scales are integrated, behavioral patterns sedimented and the effects these have on decision making. Accordingly, we offer a model of cognitively complex agents: these self-configure beliefs, intentions and desires as they engage with social organisations whose rewards demand impersonal conformity.

## Useful Items

- Enaction of organisational norms
  - it is a professional organisation which is characterised by formal positions which can be occupied by different persons
  - The positions are characterised by certain duties such as giving and executing commands. These positions describe a functional configuration (Mintzberg, 1979).
  - There exist a **strategic top management**
  - This is professionally **implemented by a middle level management** and the Cosa Nostra’s **soldiers of which do the basic work**. Thus to a certain degree Cosa Nostra can be described as a bureaucratic organisation (Weber, 1972).
  - Nevertheless, the covert nature of the organization requires adjustment. **Rather than relying on codified rules, typical for bureaucratic organizations, this method of exerting leadership requires pre-conditions.**
    - Cosa Nostra developed a system of distributed cognition that was needed - while hidden from the police, he lacked any means of ensuring that his commands had been obeyed.  Nevertheless, his leadership remained unquestioned. This demanded organizational structure whereby his individual actions could be concerted with those of the organisation’s members in order to guarantee the structure’s precarious stability
- Socio-cultural embedding of the organisation
  - Norms regulating organisational behaviour operate in a slower time scale than spontaneous interaction
  - This effect shows that the time scale of the organisational norms can only be realised when it is embedded in the even slower long-term scales of a socio-cultural heritage
